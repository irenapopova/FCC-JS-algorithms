# Regular Expressions: Match Ending String Patterns

In the last challenge, you learned to use the caret character to search for patterns at the beginning of strings. There is also a way to search for patterns at the end of strings.

You can search the end of strings using the dollar sign character $ at the end of the regex.

```javascript
let theEnding = "This is a never ending story";
let storyRegex = /story$/;
storyRegex.test(theEnding);
// Returns true
let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";
storyRegex.test(noEnding);
// Returns false
```

### Instructions

Use the anchor character ($) to match the string "caboose" at the end of the string caboose.

## Code

### Original

```javascript
let caboose = "The last car on a train is the caboose";
let lastRegex = /change/; // Change this line
let result = lastRegex.test(caboose);
```

### Solution

```javascript
let caboose = "The last car on a train is the caboose";
let lastRegex = /caboose$/; // Change this line
let result = lastRegex.test(caboose);
console.log(result);
```
